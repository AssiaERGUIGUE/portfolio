The primary objective of this data science project is to develop a robust classification system for farm insects, with special attention to identifying and differentiating the specific pests responsible for orange canker. By leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms and data analytics, we aim to create a predictive model that can accurately classify insect species based on their characteristics, behaviors, and potential impact on crops.

In this project I have used models such as RNN, LSTM, 1D-CNN to predict the engine failure 50 cycles ahead of its time, and calculated feature importance from them using sensitivity analysis and shap values. Exponential degradation and similarity-based models are also used to calculate its remaining life.

In this project, I have employed regression techniques to estimate the Power curve of an on-shore Wind turbine. Nonlinear trees based regression methods perform best as true power curve is nonlinear. XGBoost is implemented and optimized using GridSearchCV which yields lowest Test RMSE-6.404.

Objective of this project is to identify the in-control data points and eliminate out of control data points to set up distribution parameters for manufacturing process monitoring. I utilized PCA for dimension reduction and Hotelling T2 and m-CUSUM control charts to established mean and variance matrices.
